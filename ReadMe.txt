1. Game Instructions
Screen Navigation: Navigate smoothly between the two primary game screens by clicking on the arrows located at the edges of your screen or by using keyboard arrow keys. Each screen provides different functionalities—regularly switch views to effectively manage your resources, monitor enemy activities, and oversee defensive operations.
Building Upgrades: Continuously upgrade your buildings with the ‘minerals’ to keep pace with increasingly challenging waves of enemies. Each building upgrade significantly boosts your defense capabilities, increases production efficiency, and ensures greater overall effectiveness in combat.
Objective – Lava Control: Your primary objective is to stop enemies from filling the volcano with lava by preventing the lava meter from reaching its maximum level. Allow enemies to occasionally pass through strategically to manage lava production, as lava produces ‘minerals’ as well as fuels your turrets. But carefully monitor and regulate the lava meter throughout gameplay to prevent it from maxing out. Successfully balancing the lava level ensures victory.
Mineral Production: Generate and collect as many minerals as possible within the provided five-minute time limit. Minerals serve a dual purpose—they're necessary for constructing new defenses, upgrading existing structures, and they also function as your final score. Maximizing mineral production directly correlates with game performance and success.
Defensive Strategy – Turrets: Strategically build turrets across the map to effectively protect your territory from enemy invasions. Turrets can be toggled on or off to balance between defense and resource generation (lava). Regularly upgrading turrets enhances their firepower, and efficiency against progressively stronger enemy waves. Proper turret placement and timely upgrades are essential for survival and victory.
